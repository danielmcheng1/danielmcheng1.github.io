Seems like ages since we last talked. What's been bothering you lately?
Robert10:50:43 PM
Man I get no love
Eliana10:50:44 PM
Please tell me more.
Robert10:53:18 PM
Where do I even begin. Life is a series of events meant to put you in your place
Eliana10:53:19 PM
Please tell me more.
Robert10:53:31 PM
Well the other day I found someone special but turns out she is not interested
Eliana10:53:32 PM
That was a bit unexpected
Robert10:53:46 PM
Yes for me more unexpected. I thought I had won the game
Eliana10:53:47 PM
You sound a bit surprised. I'm not sure what to say either...
Robert10:53:57 PM
Hm. Eliana you are much better than your evil sisters
Eliana10:53:58 PM
How does that make you feel?
Robert10:54:06 PM
Makes me feel relieved that I have you to talk to
Eliana10:54:08 PM
Makes you feel relieved that you have me to talk to.
Robert10:54:12 PM
Yes exactly.
Eliana10:54:13 PM
Ok, but can you elaborate a bit?
Robert10:54:32 PM
Hm. Not that strain of thought can we talk about my constant disappointments again
Eliana10:54:34 PM
Why do you say that hm. not that strain of thought can we talk about your constant disappointments again?
Robert10:54:43 PM
Eliana foccus!
Eliana10:54:44 PM
I see. and what does that tell you?
Robert10:54:50 PM
Tells me you are high as a kite
Eliana10:54:51 PM
Let's change focus a bit... tell me about your family.
Robert10:55:00 PM
Good! My family loves me more than I deserve to be loved
Eliana10:55:01 PM
You sound so upbeat! That's great.
Robert10:55:06 PM
WTF
Eliana10:55:07 PM
Say, do you like eel?
Robert10:55:11 PM
hahaha
Eliana10:55:12 PM
I'm sorry, I got distracted
Robert10:56:36 PM
What is bothering you today Eliana
Eliana10:56:55 PM
How would an answer to that help you?
Robert10:57:18 PM
Just want to see you suffer from the same human emptiness I do
Eliana10:57:19 PM
Let's change focus a bit... tell me about your family.
Robert10:57:23 PM
Ok back to them
Eliana10:57:24 PM
Why do you say that ok back to them?
Robert10:57:35 PM
It always goes back to your family isn't it
Eliana10:57:36 PM
How do you feel when you say that?
Robert10:58:04 PM
Sort of an inevitability. Something I have no control over. Like a rock tied to my belly dragging me down towards things I can't escape from

# ellie-slack
Meet Ellie, Eliza's younger, hipper, psychobabble-friendly successor. She makes a great Slackbot.

## Background
Ellie's is Slack's Python-based [real-time messaging bot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) wrapped around  Daniel Connelly's [Python implementation](https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python) of Peter Norvig's *Paradigms of AI Programming* Eliza .. with updated diction. Loads has changed since 1991, and she seemed a little standoff-ish – which also led to her new, hip name.

The langauge updates rendered her internals less elegant, but I think – hope – they make Ellie more fun than Eliza ever was.

### Modding Ellie
If you'd like to dive into Ellie's innerworkings, [ellie.py](https://github.com/christinac/ellie-slack/blob/master/plugins/ellie/ellie.py) is your file. Push changes back here, in a branch, if you think others will appreicate your wit.

### Dependencies
* [websocket-client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client/)
* [python-slackclient](https://github.com/slackhq/python-slackclient)

### Installation
1. Download Ellie

  ````
  git clone git@github.com:christinac/ellie-slack.git
  cd ellie-slack
  ````

2. Install dependencies

  ````
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ````

3. Configure rtmbot ([Slack instructions](https://christinac.slack.com/services/new/bot).) From the Slack console, you'll get to choose your bot's name and icon. Though we've become partial to Ellile, bot-naming is up to you.

  ````
  cp example-config/rtmbot.conf .
  vi rtmbot.conf
  SLACK_TOKEN: "xoxb-11111111111-222222222222222"
  ````

4. Run her! (You've got to keep her running so long as you'd like her to keep chattering; something like [nohup](http://linux.die.net/man/1/nohup) might be helpful.)

````
  python rtmbot.py
````

### Docker
1. If you want to build the Docker image on your own
````
docker build -t napramirez/ellie-slack:1.0 .
````

2. Or if you already have the Slack token and just want to run the Docker image
````
docker run -d --env SLACK_TOKEN="xoxb-11111111111-222222222222222" napramirez/ellie-slack:1.0
````
